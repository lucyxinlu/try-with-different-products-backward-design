     <li>Use mineral foundation. If you are worried that regular foundation will worsen dry skin or acne problems, mineral foundation may be a good alternative. </li>
     <li>Apply BB cream. BB Cream is an all-in-one cosmetic that acts as a moisturizer, primer, SPF and foundation, reducing the amount of time it takes to put on makeup.</li>
     <li>Experiment with contouring. Contouring is a makeup technique that allows you to subtly alter your face shape.</li>
